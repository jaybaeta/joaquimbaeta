<p class='poetry-line'>The universe is dying. I hear the cold. Protons die. Light has died a long time ago. Now what remains is sound. Sound of nothing. Sound of particles decaying. Sound of decay. Sound of nothing.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>This is the end of the universe. This is the end of light. End of sound. Not in a collapse. Not in a bang. A slow decay. A slow descent. Softly, the sound whispers into nothing.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>The universe is dying. This is the end.</p>
