title: May

<p class='poetry-line'>The blood in fingers is so thick,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>It dulls their movement,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Sludging through veins as buried molasses,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>One could choose to say.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>But so sweetly,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>They sing,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>The workers who walk,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>On this night in May.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>Cold wind to the chins,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Hot air from the mouths,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Faceless polymorphs,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Mere ants in the way.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>Who would decide to live,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>When clouds dim the sky,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>And dirty rain blotches out the remaining god,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Who will hear you pray?</p>
