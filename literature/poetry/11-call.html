title: Call
---

<p class='poetry-line'>I hear crickets, cars, a gecko,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Drowned out,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>East, west, south, north,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>By calls of light, of promise,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Of answers, of guidance.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Conversations, a mosquito beside my ear, a dog,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Lost in the midst of salvation.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>I hear the calls,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>But my back is cold,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Warped by fibrous waves.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>The light my eyes see is distant,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Fire waned by time.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>In their directionless fury, my guidance awaits,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Somehow.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>I will find what I want, eventually,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Whatever it may be,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Eventually,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Once the answers, freely given,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>End,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Whenever that may be.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>The fire might not burn forever,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>But it will certainly outlast you, and me.</p>
<br />
<p class='poetry-line'>I hear the calls,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Recede inward, one by one.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>I pray I will hear my answers now,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>In prostration to the silent sky,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Drowned out,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>By crickets, cars, a gecko.</p>
