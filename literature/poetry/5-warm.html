<p class='poetry-line'>He woke up one morning, no different from the previous day. </p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Cloudy and humid, and warm. </p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Then he remembered that great war, that one in which he was destined to die, that one fought for nothing. </p>
<p class='poetry-line'>He remembered.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>He would wake up in those days as monotonously as any previous day.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Cloudy and humid. Warm.</p>            
<p class='poetry-line'>Then the sun would pierce through thick leaves and scorch skin.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>White, pimpled faces had turned so red in that great war, they shone in the sea of green as did the tomatoes in their wivesâ€™ salads.</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Sliced in quarters, as red pored through the holes in their bellies.</p>
