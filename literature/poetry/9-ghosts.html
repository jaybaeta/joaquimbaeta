<p class='poetry-line'>Seekers of independence,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>Define yourselves not by what you have cast aside,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>But by what you have allowed to remain behind,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>For once you have abandoned chains and shadows,</p>
<p class='poetry-line'>The ghosts you create become your own.</p>
