          <p class="action">TWO SILHOUETTES - one female, one male - sit at a small table.&nbsp; Through the white of the window beyond them, they are but shadows facing each other in despondent hunches.</p>

          <p class="action">Between them is a small, square box, held together by what appears to be a thick shoelace.</p>

          <p class="sceneheading">ext.&nbsp; city</p>

          <p class="action">Ancient towers and bloated spires rise into a sky bespeckled with glimmering points of light, some brighter than others.&nbsp; Their numbers are so immense that their light dwarfs that of the Sun, dulling the sky into a bland grey.</p>

          <p class="action">The streets are silent.&nbsp; There are no humans, no visible life.</p>

          <p class="dialog">For billions of years, two galaxies are heading toward collision.&nbsp; In their wake, mass transformation of solar systems.&nbsp; The Oort is destroyed, followed by the Jovian system.&nbsp; Earth survives, but with the dying Sun, its best hope is that gravitational forces give it a new star.</p>

          <p class="character">MALE SILHOUETTE</p>

          <p class="dialog">And?</p>

          <p class="character">FEMALE SILHOUETTE</p>

          <p class="dialog">Billions.&nbsp; Yet we did nothing.&nbsp; Instead, we wait and we leave.</p>

          <p class="action">Suddenly, a MAN jarringly sits up.&nbsp; He lets a thick globule of dark blood ooze from his mouth, too weak to spit it out. His voice broken, he croaks out a response:</p>

          <p class="character">dying man</p>

          <p class="dialog">Shut up!&nbsp; Humans don't change... just wait for Holy Mother.</p>

          <p class="action">A HULKING FIGURE bursts through a gaping window, landing on the pavement with a heavy THUD.&nbsp; His clothing is an insignificant, ugly light-brown, splattered with dark ash, counterpointed by his headgear -- a string of cloth tightly wrapped over his eyes, which would blind him were the brightness outside not so overpowering.</p>

          <p class="character">hulking figure</p>

          <p class="dialog">Blind one!</p>

          <p class="action">Behind him, the BLIND ONE crawls through the same window, gingerly feeling for where to lay his feet down.&nbsp; No less inconspicuously dressed, he is devoid of any eye protection, for he cannot see.&nbsp; Safely on the ground, he pats himself and turns in the vague direction of his comrade.</p>

          <p class="character">blind one</p>

          <p class="dialog">Lead the way, Nebulin.</p>

          <p class="character">FEMALE SILHOUETTE</p>

          <p class="dialog">What I'm saying is, we had the chance to prepare.&nbsp;
          It's such a waste.&nbsp; Nebulin and the Blind One must have discarded
          countless treasures to find the Relic.</p>

          <p class="character">DYING MAN</p>

          <p class="action">The Male Silhouette drags him up to the chair and
          guides his arm to hold the bloody cloth in place.&nbsp; He pats the Dying
          Man on the shoulder.</p>

          <p class="dialog">Don't worry.&nbsp; You'll see justice before you die.</p>

          <p class="action">Suddenly, the Blind One shifts.&nbsp; His body slumps from its erect posture.&nbsp; He bows his head in submission.&nbsp; Nebulin grasps the knife sticking through his belt, even though his face shows that he knows it's useless.</p>

          <p class="dialog">Wise Mother, protect me.</p>

          <p class="action">The Blind One shows no fear, only resignation, but his body tightens as though something is nearing him.</p>

          <p class="action">Tears form.&nbsp; Nebulin lets go of the knife.&nbsp; In the Blind One's blank face, he sees his own fate.&nbsp; Doom.&nbsp; Nebulin slumps, when --</p>
