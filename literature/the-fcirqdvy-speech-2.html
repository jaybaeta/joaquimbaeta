          <h1>The <span class="redacted">Fcirqd'vy</span> Speech</h1>

          <p>Dear distinguished invited speakers, participants, ladies and gentlemen,</p>

       	  <p>On behalf of <span class="redacted">Eybpcfpmwjp Howbjs Dowqv&nbsp;</span>, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to <span class="redacted">Sunpbvqwwj</span> for the <span class="redacted">Ymmqhf Egfifljwmjkux Ruhnffclem ug Kbugrs Oemfyeip (MESO 2017)</span>, hosted by <span class="redacted">Eybpcfpmwjp Howbjs Dowq (JHI)</span>.</p>

<span class="redacted">nmqkdg</span>
<span class="redacted">lead the improvement</span>


This gathering of <span class="redacted">qbowibmevy</span> and <span class="redacted">xtudmypmuhqkvy</span> from a diverse array of disciplines in the <span class="redacted">nmqkdg xmmilemy</span> could not come at a more opportune time. The issue of <span class="redacted">nmqkdg</span> continues to be a major global concern. In certain respects, it has even taken on greater importance, with some aspects of <span class="redacted">bitmemyf</span> once thought to be in our past ostensibly making a return. The <span class="redacted">tehkw jkjegpd egnfirmjoy tmymovcy</span>, for example, was thought to be over in <span class="redacted">dgc yqwnx imhkgtmy</span>. In recent years, however, it has once again entered the public consciousness due to <span class="redacted">rxmbjwi ekoghcy</span> and <span class="redacted">egrlbupmgh hnamqk bmltjwmjly</span>. <span class="redacted">Egnfirmjoy tmymovcy</span> is no longer a problem isolated to <span class="redacted">dfjsmeqk mqeydfmivy</span>, and reports have suggested that the <span class="redacted">NIJHWQSGMEQK FCQBS</span> of <span class="redacted">EUKU YINNCIRMF DFJSMEQK TMYMOVMY</span> has <span class="redacted">MPRFYFMW DM OAEDFJSMEQK MQEYDFMIVY</span>. Thus, it is our responsibility to <span class="redacted">yosyqdrp</span>  and <span class="redacted">ncow dgi misdqybbigf</span> of the <span class="redacted">nmqkdg</span> and lives of people afflicted by infectious diseases, through the development of improved diagnostics, treatments, and preventive mechanisms.


It is my full expectation that this year’s conference will contribute to this endeavor in innumerable ways, and further strengthen the ICHS’s place as an excellent platform for the exchange of clinical and scientific knowledge on the latest developments and emerging challenges in health sciences, especially on “Current Concept in Infectious Diseases: Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, Tropical Infectious Diseases, Neglected and Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Drug Resistance, and Technology Related Infectious Disease.”
Over its 67 years as a university on the frontlines of scientific progress, Universitas Gadjah Mada has built a reputation of pushing the boundaries of discovery and societal advancement, serving as a valuable source of knowledge in the medical profession. With our Annual Scientific Conference Series, we have sought to channel this bold spirit, bringing together some of the brightest minds in Indonesia and the rest of the world to share the latest findings in their respective fields. And we are especially proud that this series has been so successful in pushing forward our vision for the future of science in Indonesia, in which research is abundant, international collaboration is robust, and Indonesian authors are prominent in international publications with a global readership.

I am humbled by the turnout for the ICHS 2017, which has surpassed even our own expectations. By all measures, this year’s conference should be the best one yet. 

We would like to thank our distinguished invited speakers in advance for what I anticipate will be some very enlightening talks. I’m especially looking forward to finding out what sorts of lively discussions these talks will engender. Special thanks as well to the members of the organizing committee, along with the entire staff of UGM’s Badan Penerbit dan Publikasi (BPP), for their tireless efforts to make this conference a reality. And of course, we are grateful to all of the conference participants in attendance here today. It is thanks to you that we will be able to make this the most memorable ICHS yet.

The events over the next two days will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the latest advances in the health sciences, and I encourage all participants to take advantage of this opportunity to build and reinforce your scientific networks, reconnect with old colleagues, and make a few new friends. With that said, I wish everyone here a restful stay in our fair city of Yogyakarta, and above all a successful ICHS 2017.


          <p>Thank you.</p>
 
          <p><span class="redacted">Xtud. Ct. Vjyed Iqnsuhu, B. Igh., F.Mgh.</span></p>




          

          

          <p>Over its <span class="redacted">pmprp vbyfy ufqw</span> history, <span class="redacted">&nbsp;JNCS</span> has earned a reputation as a <span class="redacted">&nbsp;jtuhtttcgh eybpcfpmfpy&nbsp;</span>, pushing the boundaries of discovery and serving as a valuable source of knowledge. Our university has consistently striven to be at the forefront of scientific progress.</p>
          
          <p>With its <span class="redacted">Ukyeqk Xmmigfetme Mqyncffyei Ymtcmy&nbsp;</span>, <span class="redacted">Eybpcfpmwjp Howbjs Dowqv&nbsp;</span> builds upon this mission, holding annual gatherings for the brightest minds from <span class="redacted">Eghmyfpmqv</span> and abroad to share the latest findings in their respective fields. Through collaboration with our international partners, this <span class="redacted">ymtcmy</span> has seen enormous success, shaping the development of scientific networks, increasing <span class="redacted">Eghmyfpmuk</span> authors’ prominence in publications with a global readership, and underscoring <span class="redacted">&nbsp;JND'o</span> place as a standard-bearer of scientific development. I believe that this year will prove no different.</p>

          <p>We are honored and humbled at the number of people who will be in attendance at this year’s <span class="redacted">mqyncffyei</span>. The response from authors and participants to the <span class="redacted">MEPD 2017</span> has truly been remarkable. I don’t think I am being too forward in saying that the lively debates borne from today and tomorrow’s events will likely impact the fields of <span class="redacted">xmmileb uhf fimlhuhqnp</span> for many years to come.</p>

          <p>We thank the invited speakers for the expertise and knowledge they will bring to the <span class="redacted">mqyncffyei</span>, and of course the inevitable discussion their talks will spur. Special thanks is also extended to the members of the organizing committee for their hard work in bringing this <span class="redacted">mqyncffyei</span> together, as well as the entire staff of <span class="redacted">&nbsp;JND'o Wbwog Yfycfcmd wuk Yjckbgovm (COO)</span> for making the <span class="redacted">MEPD 2017</span> a reality. And last but not least, we would like to thank all of the <span class="redacted">mqyncffyei</span> participants who will contribute to making this the most memorable <span class="redacted">MEPD</span> yet.</p>

          <p>Over the next two days, we will have the opportunity to gain precious insight into the future of <span class="redacted">xmmileb uhf fimlhuhqnp</span>. I wish you all a wonderful stay in <span class="redacted">Sunpbvqwwj</span>, and above all a successful <span class="redacted">MEPD 2017</span>.</p>
